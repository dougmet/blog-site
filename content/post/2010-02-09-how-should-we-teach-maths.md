I came across [this new
feature](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/from-fish-to-infinity/)
in the NYT via [Science
Blogs](http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/2010/02/when_you_stack_l-shapes_togeth.php)
by Steven Strogatz. You may remember him from his paper with Duncan
Watts on [small-worlds](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F30918) that arguably
kick started modern network theory. It looks like it's going to be a
regular series so I highly recommend adding the
[feed](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/steven-strogatz/feed/)
to your rss reader.  
  
The article that first caught my eye was called [Rock
Groups](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/rock-groups/).
It starts by differentiating between the serious side of arithmetic and
the playful side. This is something I've long gone on about but never
quite had the nice way of putting it like these guys do. Maths teaching
for kids is like torture. I was having a discussion a while ago where I
questioned whether we really needed to recite endless times tables aged
10 years old. A suggestion that drew scorn from my opposite number. But
really, why?  
  
The book that is heavily quoted in the article, "[A Mathematician's
Lament](http://www.blpbooks.org/books/mathlament.html)" by Paul
Lockhart. It starts with a musician having a nightmare that children are
not allowed to touch an instrument until they have mastered the theory
of music and how to read a score. Only after many painful years are they
allowed to lay their hands on an instrument.  
  
This is a powerful analogy. You don't have to learn all the nuts and
bolts of mathematics before you can start playing with numbers. Back in
the Strogatz article he shows how much you can discover without being
able to do any addition at all, just by grouping rocks. I wish I could
quickly multiply two large numbers in my head but it wouldn't make me a
better mathematician. It's like arguing that the best playwright should
be able to spell every word in the dictionary.  
  
The beautiful thing about the rocks is that it shows how much you can
learn about number by pushing things around with your hands and being
creative. Perhaps all those people who complain to me that "oo I could
never do maths me" would have enjoyed it more if it was based on this
rather than being expected to master "a complex set of algorithms for
manipulating Hindi symbols".  
  
Make sure you keep up with the Strogatz series. I found a [pdf of the
essay](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) that inspired the
Lockhart book. If I ever get through my Christmas backlog I might get
around the getting the book.
