The New York Times is running a piece about tap water and the regulation
thereof called "[That Tap Water Is Legal but May Be
Unhealthy](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html)". One
particular contaminant becomes dangerous on exposure to sunlight so, at
a lake in Los Angeles, they've tipped 400,000 plastic balls into the
lake to block out the sunlight.  
  
Perhaps this shows I've been in stat-mech too long. All I could think
about upon seeing this picture was - "cool, a massive 2D elastic disc
simulation!".

It's quite interesting where the crystal structure is interrupted - each
one of those interfaces costs a lot of free energy. You can also see
it's not truly 2D as along certain stress lines the particles have gone
up and over to reduce the energy.  
  
I wonder if it's in equilibrium or whether it'll age with time...  
  
This is what science can do to you :-s  
  
Don't know what fair use would be for stealing this photo but hopefully
if I [link to the NYT
enough](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/12/17/us/20091217WATER_index.html)
they won't mind - go and click on one of their ads of something...
