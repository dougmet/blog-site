One of the things I love about colloids is just how visual they are. Be
it watching them jiggling around under a [confocal
microscope](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/pt/paddy/movie.swf), or the
[beautiful TEM](http://physics.nyu.edu/pine/Pine___Res___Clusters.html)
images of crystal structures, I always find them quite inspirational, or
at least instructional, for better understanding statistical
mechanics.  

#### Sedimentation

Just to prove I'm on the cutting edge of science, I recently discovered
another neat example from 1993. At the liquid matter conference in
Vienna [Roberto
Piazza](http://www.chem.polimi.it/people/faculty/roberto-piazza/) gave a
talk titled "The unbearable heaviness of colloids". As a side note there
was a distinct lack of playful titles, maybe people were too nervous at
such a big meeting. Anyway, the talk was about sedimentation of
colloids.  
  
Sedimentation is something I don't usually like to think about because
gravity, as any particle physicist will agree, is a massive pain in the
arse. Never-the-less, my experimental colleagues are somewhat stuck with
it (well,Â [most of
them](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs12grc.html)). As is
often the way it turns out you can turn this into a big advantage. What
[Piazza did](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.4267), and
then [others later](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.53.5043),
was to use the sedimentation profile of a colloidal suspension to get
the full equation of state, in fact the full phase diagram, from a
single sample.

The nicest example is from [Paul
Chaikin's](http://physics.nyu.edu/~pc86/index.html) lab (now in NYU,
then in Princeton), where they used a colloidal suspension that was
really close to hard spheres. They mixed a bunch of these tiny snooker
balls in suspension, and then let it settle for three months. What they
got is this lovely sample, with crystal at the bottom (hence the strange
scattering of the light), and then a dense liquid which eventually
becomes a low density gas at the top. It's as though the whole phase
diagram is laid out before you.  
  

#### Equation of State

This is a very beautiful illustration, but it's not the best bit. In the
same way that atmospheric pressure is due to the weight of the air above
you, if you can weigh the colloids above a particular point in the
sample then you can calculate the pressure at that point. This is
exactly what they did. There are many different ways to measure the
density of colloids at a particular height, if you can do it accurately
enough (which was the big breakthrough in Piazza's 1993 paper) then you
can calculate the density as a function of pressure. In a system where
temperature plays no role such as this, this is exactly the equation of
state (EoS).

When compared with theoretical calculations for hard spheres the
experimental data lies perfectly on the theory curves, complete with
first order phase transition where it crystallises. This is really a
lovely thing. EoSs are very sensitive to exact details, so in the same
way that in my group we compare our simulation of the EoS to check our
code, this showed very accurately that their colloids really were hard
spheres.  
  
So I think this is all very nice. I nicked the above images from [Paul
Chaikin's website](http://physics.nyu.edu/~pc86/index.html), I recommend
having a poke around, there's loads of great stuff (you really need to
see the m&ms).
