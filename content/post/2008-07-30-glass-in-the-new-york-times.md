When people think of physics they tend to think of particle
accelerators, string theory, E=mcÂ² and so on, so when I tell them I'm
studying glass they always look a little disappointed. Anyway, a couple
of weeks ago we got a [New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/science/29glass.html?pagewanted=2&_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss)
article from a guy called Kenneth Chang so we're all quite pleased about
it. I had written a long post about it but I ended up just repeating
what's in the article, so I've decided to list some main points and
provide a few extra links.  
  
He managed to give a good sense as to how much debate there is in the
field. One thing everyone agrees on however, and where the article
begins, is that cathedral windows do <span
style="font-style: italic;">not</span><span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>sag because the glass has flowed.

If you want something that does do that then let me point you in the
direction of
[pitch,](http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/pitchdrop/pitchdrop.shtml) which
drips about once a decade but shatters when hit with a hammer. So what
is glass then? Is it a liquid or what?  
  
Glass has the same structure as a liquid. If you take a photo you
couldn't really tell the difference. A liquid that's on its way to being
a glass, a [supercool
liquid](/2008/07/supercooling.html),
is the same as well. If instead of a photo you look at a video you'll
see that it's actually really different. [Weeks and
company](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;287/5453/627?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=weeks&title=direct&andorexacttitle=or&andorexacttitleabs=or&andorexactfulltext=or&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&fdate=7/1/1880&tdate=8/31/2008&resourcetype=HWCIT,HWELTR)
have actually done this and you can see regions really close to one
another, some with lots of motion, some hardly moving at all. This is
the dynamic heterogeneity, mentioned in the article, that goes along
with the hugely increasing viscosity. Their
[website](http://www.physics.emory.edu/%7Eweeks/lab/glass/) has loads of
great stuff, including movies and a link to a freely available version
of the Science paper, I recommend taking a look.  
  
The region that I'm roughly poking about in at the moment is to do with
vibrations and rigidity. This is touched on in the article a couple of
times. Matthieu Wyart and others have spent a lot of time developing the
idea of a glass as a marginally rigid solid (the introduction to
[Wyart's thesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0512155) is actually
quite readable and freely accessible). It's looking at how the random
liquid structure affects things at low temperatures.  
  
Anyway, I'll leave it there. If I've missed any important links just
stick them in a comment. Been a bit too busy writing my thesis to do
this properly. Dear God let it end soon!
