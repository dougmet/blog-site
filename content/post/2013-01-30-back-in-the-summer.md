I realise things have gone pretty quiet around here. It turns out having
a baby takes away pretty much any spare time you thought you had.  
  
I still have big plans for this blog and as the number of times I'm wide
awake at 3am decreases I can see the light at the end of the sleep
deprived tunnel. So I'm planning to have a quiet relaunch in the summer
when I'll hopefully get some regularity back.  
  
See you soon.
