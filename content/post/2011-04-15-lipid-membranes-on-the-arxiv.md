A while ago I discussed [lipid
membranes](/2009/08/biological-membranes.html)
and how they could exhibit critical behaviour. There were some lovely
pictures on criticality on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) which are
sort of model cell walls. That work was done by Sarah Keller and friends
in Seattle.  
  
This morning on the arXiv I saw this new paper, also by Sarah:  
  
[Dynamic critical exponent in a 2D lipid membrane with conserved order
parameter](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2613)  
  
They look at the critical dynamics of the GUV's surface. Being embedded
in a 3D fluid does have its consequences so they've attempted to account
for the effect of hydrodynamic interactions. I haven't poured over their
model but the paper looks really nice.
