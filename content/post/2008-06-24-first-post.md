Welcome to my new blog. I haven't quite worked out what to do with it
yet but I think it's good to have a blog, the internet's already full of
useless crap so this isn't going to make it any worse.  
  
Right now I'm writing my thesis so I doubt I'll be putting much on here
but when I do I suspect it'll mainly be based on the two things:
physicsy stuff and statistics stuff. The former should be mainly
positive (things I think are really interesting) and the latter will be
mostly negative (ranting about stats-abuse). I guess we'll see how it
goes.

[Update from future Doug in 2021]
As I've migrated sites I decided to hang on to these blog posts. It's fun reading your own voice from the past, it's me but different, I like that. Some of it is wonderful, some of it makes me cringe a bit (like the phrase "useless crap" ðŸ‘†). I decided to take out one or two of the more ranty posts. Maybe the internet wasn't so poisonous back in 2008, maybe it was. But reading it now I thought they could probably be retired. Anyway, enough from old Doug.
