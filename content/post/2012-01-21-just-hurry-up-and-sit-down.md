As a semi frequent flyer, and incredibly impatient stand-behinderer I
couldn't resist linking to this - [Time needed to board an airplane: A
power law and the structure behind
it](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.011130) from a Norwegian
group, Vidar Frette and Per Hemmer.  
  
Boarding strategy is of great importance to airlines, where the turn
around time of planes – especially short haul – can make a real dent in
profits. For the authors of this paper, however, it seems they just
think it's a neat model to test out 1D problems where the particles are
distinguishable, rather than the more common indistinguishable
particles. In a traffic model the cars are usually identical, whereas
here the passengers have a specific seat booking. Statistically this
makes a difference.  
  
Of course many people do look at specific strategies. For example
[here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221701002946),
it seems that it's difficult to think up a strategy that beats random
loading. One would think that loading back-to-front would be better but
this is not the case. A quick google search finds this nice page
from [Menkes van den
Briel](http://menkes76.com/projects/boarding/boarding.htm). There you
can see videos of all the different strategies.  
  
Unfortunately the best strategy seems to involve seating people in order
of window/middle/aisle. Not great if you're sitting next to your kids.  
  
All of which did remind me that it is much quicker boarding when you
don't have seat bookings. When I fly to England using a certain
orange-themed airline, that doesn't book seats, there's an initial mêlée
followed by reasonably rapid sitting down. On a certain royal
blue-themed airline it takes forever for a plane half the size to get
sat down.
