Time for more critical phenomena.  

#### Another critical intro

I've talked about this [a
lot](/2009/05/critical-point.html)
[before](/2009/08/biological-membranes.html)
so I will only very quickly go back over it. The phase transitions
you're probably used to are water boiling to steam or freezing to ice.
Now water is, symmetrically, very different from ice. So to go from one
to the other you need to start building an interface and then slowly
grow your new phase (crystal growth). This is called a first order phase
transition and it's the only way to make ice.  
  
Now water and steam are, symmetrically, the same. At most pressures the
transition still goes the same way â€“ build an interface and grow.
However, if you crank up the pressure enough there comes a special point
where the distinction between the two phases becomes a bit fuzzy. The
cost of building an interface goes to zero so there's no need to grow
anything. You just smoothly change between the two. This is a second
order, or continuous, phase transition and it's what I mean by a
critical point.  
  
As I've demonstrated before, one of the consequences of criticality is a
loss of a [sense of scale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi-g2ET97W8).
This is why, for instance, a critical fluid looks cloudy. Light is being
scattered by structure at every scale. This insight is embodied in the
theory of the renormalisation group, and it got lots of people prizes.  

#### Universality

A second feature of critical phenomena is universality. Close to the
critical point it turns out that the physics of a system doesn't depend
on the exact details of what the little pieces are doing, but only on
broad characteristics such as dimension, symmetry or whether the
interaction is long or short ranged. Two systems that share these
properties are in the same universality class and will behave
identically around the critical point.  
  
At this stage you may not have a good picture in your head of what I
mean, it does sound a bit funny. So I've made a movie to demonstrate the
point. The movie shows two systems at criticality. On the left will be
an Ising model for a magnet. Each site can be up or down (north or
south) and neighbouring sites like to line up. The two phases at the
critical point are the opposite magnetisations represented here by black
and white squares.

On the right will be a Lennard-Jones fluid. This is a model for how
simple atoms like Argon interact. Atoms are attracted to one another at
close enough range but a strong repulsion prevents overlap. The two
phases in this case are a dense liquid and a sparse gas.

One of these systems lives on a lattice, the other is particles in a
continuous space that are free to move around. Very different as you can
see from the pictures. However, what happens when we look on a slightly
bigger length scale? Role the tape!  

  
  
At the end of the movie (which you can view HD) the scale is about a
thousand particle diameters across containing about 350,000 particles
and similar for the magnet. At this distance you just can't tell which
is which. This demands an important point: These pictures I've been
making don't just show a critical Ising model, they pretty much show you
what *any* two-dimensional critical system looks like (isotropic, short
range...). Even something complicated from outside of theory land. And
this is why the theory of critical phenomena is so powerful, something
that works for the simplest model we can think of applies exactly - not
approximately - to real life atoms and molecules, or whatever's around
the kitchen.
